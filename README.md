# ArchHood
Virtual Reality Android 3D Game

## Motto

- ArchHood is an Android-based virtual reality 3D sport archery game in which player play as an archer, using real eyes coordination to shoot the targets with a technology called virtual reality.

- Using a mobile built-in gyroscope sensor to achieving an approach of 360 rotations that helps to simulate the view in 360 scenes, and by using this approach player can shoot on targets that are placed at different positions.

- Implementation of a prototype that uses virtual reality best practices. Because itâ€™s big problem in VR to give a user experience that is free to motion sickness. 

- My second goal is to entertain the players by exploring small tasks. 

- Interaction in VR is a big challenge so plan to use some inserting techniques to perform a behavior in an environment and what are the effective ways to interact with objects. 

- Dealing with different game-mechanics and programming paradigms.
